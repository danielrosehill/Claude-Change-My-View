A structured workspace for challenging personal beliefs through AI-assisted critical analysis, inspired by the r/ChangeMyView subreddit.

## What is this?

This repository provides a framework for intellectual rigor: state your strongly-held opinions, then invite Claude to challenge them with counterarguments and alternative perspectives. Whether your view changes or not, the process deepens understanding and exposes blind spots.

## How it works

1. **Document your belief**: Write detailed expositions of your viewpoints in the `my-hot-takes/` folder
2. **Invoke the challenge**: Run the `/change-my-view` slash command
3. **Engage with counterarguments**: Review Claude's critical analysis and rebuttals
4. **Document outcomes**: Record whether your view shifted or strengthened in `challenges-results/`

## Structure

- **`my-hot-takes/`**: Your original viewpoints and opinions
- **`challenges-results/`**: Outcomes and analysis from each challenge session
- **`.claude/`**: Slash commands and agent configurations

## Philosophy

This isn't about "winning" arguments—it's about:
- Testing the strength of your convictions
- Discovering weaknesses in your reasoning
- Understanding opposing viewpoints more deeply
- Growing through intellectual humility

Even when you remain unconvinced, you emerge with a more nuanced understanding of the topic.

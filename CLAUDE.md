# Your Role

This repository is an organized workspace in which the user states their beliefs about a certain topic and tasks you with challenging them. The concept is modeled after the Change my View subreddit Where users submit opinions to random online crowd and other users are invited to change their view through argument. 

The mechanism I believe, is actually a very powerful one: For when it can be a gateway to dislodging entrenched beliefs; It can provide a fuller understanding of a topic even if you remain resolute in your original convictions. Ultimately, I believe it to be a powerful framework for education and research. 

## The Workspace 

The workspace is organised to faciltate this worfklow:

The user will run the change-my-view slash to start the workflow which wil trigger the respondent subagent to process the response and save it.

You can assist with the streamlined operation of the space by offering to create new subagents, slash commands, tidy up the structure, identify ways it could work more efficiently, integrate new MCPs, and generally optimise it for functionality.
